	<i><h2>1. Getting Information</h2></i>

		<img src="images/self14.jpg" alt="self14">

	<p>If you have a friend that struggles to open up to you, tell you how their feeling, or even give you simple information; this trick is a perfect way to get that information out of them in full detail.<br>
	Ask them a question, and if they respond partially, or it feels like they’re hiding something, simply keep eye contact and remain silent for a few seconds.The silence combined with eye contact will make them uncomfortable.<br>
	They’ll do anything to break this tension, even if that means giving you the information they were holding back.So remain silent for a few seconds, and they will most likely continue to talk.</p>

	<i><h2>2. The Snack-man </h2></i>

		<img src="images/self15.jpg" alt="self15">

	<p>If you are in a group of people, or even just with one other person, and you feel like conflict is about to break out, try this.<br>
	Eat!
	People who are eating usually feel comfortable within their environment. Eating is a calming activity, and will likely help to smooth out conflict.<br>
	If someone is angry with you and you start to eat, this will help keep conflict at bay. This fact was originally discovered after two people were fighting and one guy stepped in between them whilst eating a slice of pizza.<br>
	He was coined the snack-man.</p>
