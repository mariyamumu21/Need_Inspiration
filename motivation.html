<p>Some of the most memorable lessons in life come from stories.The great thing about them is that they’re so easy to digest, and there’s always a moral at the end of the story.</p>

<h1>1. Three Feet From Gold</h1>

<img src="images/self11.jpg" alt="self11">

<p>During the gold rush, a man who had been mining in Colorado for several months quit his job, as he hadn’t struck gold yet and the work was becoming tiresome.  He sold his equipment to another man who resumed mining where it had been left off. The new miner was advised by his engineer that there was gold only three feet away from where the first miner stopped digging.</p>

<p>The engineer was right, which means the first miner was a mere three feet away from striking gold before he quit.</p>

<h3>Moral of the story:</h3>
<p>When things start to get hard, try to persevere through the adversity. Many people give up on following their dreams because the work becomes too difficult, tedious, or tiresome–but often, you’re closer to the finish line than you may think, and if you push just a little harder, you will succeed.</p>

<h1>2. The Butterfly (Struggles)</h1>

<img src="images/self12.jpg" alt="self12">

<p>A man found a cocoon of a butterfly.One day a small opening appeared. He sat and watched the butterfly for several hours as it struggled to force its body through that little hole.Until it suddenly stopped making any progress and looked like it was stuck.So the man decided to help the butterfly. He took a pair of scissors and snipped off the remaining bit of the cocoon. The butterfly then emerged easily, although it had a swollen body and small, shriveled wings.</p>

<p>The man didn’t think anything of it and sat there waiting for the wings to enlarge to support the butterfly. But that didn’t happen. The butterfly spent the rest of its life unable to fly, crawling around with tiny wings and a swollen body.Despite the kind heart of the man, he didn’t understand that the restricting cocoon and the struggle needed by the butterfly to get itself through the small opening; were God’s way of forcing fluid from the body of the butterfly into its wings. To prepare itself for flying once it was out of the cocoon.</p>

<h3>Moral of the story:</h3>
<p>Our struggles in life develop our strengths. Without struggles, we never grow and never get stronger, so it’s important for us to tackle challenges on our own, and not be relying on help from others.</p>
